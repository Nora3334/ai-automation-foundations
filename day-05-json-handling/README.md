## Day 5: JSON Data Processing for Automation

### Business Problem
Customer data often arrives in JSON format from CRMs, APIs, or web forms. Manual updates are error-prone and inefficient.

### Solution
This script:
- Reads customer data from a JSON file
- Applies business rules to update lead status
- Writes updated data back to a new JSON file

### AI Relevance
This mirrors real-world AI automation patterns:
- Preprocessing input before AI inference
- Storing enriched data after AI or rule-based decisions
- Acting as a bridge between APIs and AI agents

### Key Concepts Used
- JSON file handling
- Data transformation
- Persistent storage
- Automation-friendly outputs

### Outcome
A production-ready pattern used in AI pipelines, workflow automation, and agent-based systems.
