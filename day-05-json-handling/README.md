## Day 5: JSON Processing with AI-Simulated Lead Classification

### Business Problem
Small businesses want to automatically classify customer leads based on engagement data before routing them to sales or marketing workflows.

### Solution
This project demonstrates a production-style AI automation pattern:
1. Read customer data from JSON
2. Apply business logic
3. Simulate an AI (LLM) decision layer
4. Output structured results for downstream automation

### AI Simulation
Instead of calling a live LLM API, this project uses:
- A realistic LLM prompt template
- A mock AI JSON response

This mirrors real-world system design while keeping the project lightweight and cost-free.

### AI Relevance
This pattern is used in:
- AI lead scoring systems
- CRM automation
- AI agents that enrich structured data

### Key Concepts Used
- JSON read/write
- Prompt engineering fundamentals
- AI-ready data contracts
- Automation-safe outputs

### Outcome
A portfolio-ready AI automation foundation that can be upgraded to a live LLM with minimal changes.
