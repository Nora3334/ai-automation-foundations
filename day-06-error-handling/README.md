## Day 6: Error Handling & Resilient Automation

### Business Problem
Automation systems frequently encounter:
- Missing files
- Corrupt data
- Incomplete records

Crashes reduce trust and operational reliability.

### Solution
This project demonstrates:
- Graceful handling of missing files
- Safe continuation after errors
- Defensive coding practices

### AI Relevance
AI automation systems must be resilient:
- AI inputs may be malformed
- External APIs may fail
- Partial results must still be processed

This script models how production AI systems handle failures safely.

### Key Concepts Used
- try / except blocks
- File and JSON error handling
- Logging warnings instead of crashing

### Outcome
A robust automation pattern suitable for AI agents, backend workflows, and consulting-grade solutions.
