## Day 4: Customer Data Structuring & Summarization

### Business Problem
Small businesses often store customer data in unstructured formats, making it difficult to generate insights or prepare data for AI-driven automation.

### Solution
This project demonstrates how to:
- Store customer records using Python dictionaries
- Loop through structured data
- Generate summaries such as:
  - Total customers
  - Active customers
  - Leads per industry

### AI Relevance
Clean, structured data is a prerequisite for:
- AI lead scoring
- CRM automation
- LLM-based classification pipelines

This script simulates the preprocessing step before data is sent to an AI model.

### Key Concepts Used
- Lists of dictionaries
- Aggregation logic
- Conditional checks
- Business-oriented summaries

### Outcome
A reusable data structure that can plug directly into AI workflows or automation pipelines.
